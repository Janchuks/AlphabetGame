# Alphabet Game

## Description
The Alphabet Game is designed to help Latvian children expand their knowledge of the Latvian alphabet in a fun way! The game features images and buttons where the child must press a button corresponding to the letter represented by the image.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Children are shown images, and they must select the correct letter from two options.
- **Scoring System**: It tracks how many times the child selects the correct button.
- **Dynamic Image and Letter Selection**: When the child selects the correct letter, the image and buttons are updated.

## Installation

### Requirements
You can install Pillow using pip:

Make sure to have your images (e.g., arbuzs.png, apple.png, etc.) in the same directory as the script or update the image paths in the code accordingly.

### Code Structure
